  - such as a general text announcement channel where users have the perms to react to things--now they have the ability to create threads there as well 
  (POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: add under /server permissions for channels you can/can't use flag translations in (annoying to do with replit db); flag translation configurations: disabled by default(?)/only abridged translations allowed/threads allowed/none/channel-specifics)
  
  - cannot use this flag translations inside threads
  (POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: send special abridged thread versions of the translations, also include a close button to delete the translation message (why not this for all flag translations then? clogging up the channel?))

  - flag translations may not work when thread limit reached 
  (POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: send abridged versions of the translations (may be annoying))
